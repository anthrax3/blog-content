Time for our final speaker announcement: Patrick Hamann, Nadieh Bremer and Shirley Wu will join us for CSSconf EU! 
For the second time after 2014, Patrick will bring us up to speed with the latest developments around browser performance. And for the first time, we’ll have a double talk! Nadieh and Shirley will share their learnings from creating data visualizations with web technologies, and how collaboration drives their creative process.

### data sketch|es: A Visualization a Month

Data sketches is a collaboration between Nadieh and Shirley, where they choose a topic and visualize it by the end of the month. The collaboration started for many reasons: they weren’t creating as many personal data visualization projects, so they were looking for the motivation to make more. They wanted to explore their creativity, to experiment with the tools that are out there, to learn from each other, and to have fun. 

In their talk for CSSconf EU 2017, Shirley and Nadieh will share the lessons they learned while working on data sketches. They will highlight their favorite months of data, sketches, and code: what made them their favorites, the mistakes made along the way, and how they overcame them. They hope that by sharing their visualizations’ humble, ugly duckling beginnings and their many (embarrassing) iterations, that it will inspire others to create their own unique and compelling visualizations.

## Patrick Hamann
### CSS and the First Meaningful Paint

![Patrick Hamann](patrick-hamann-blog.png)

To render a webpage browsers needs to go through the complex dance of networking, parsing and painting before any content can be displayed to your user. Over the years, we’ve developed mechanisms and hacks to aid the browser at each stage of this process, but these have always come at some cost or trade-off.

How can we utlilise modern web platform features to load our CSS as fast as possible? Should we still be inlining our critical content into the document or instead, how can HTTP/2 server push and Service Workers help us? 

In this talk we will take a journey exploring the current, past, and future best-practices for loading CSS in the browser and how we can achieve a first meaningful paint within 1000ms. Ultimately creating a faster, more resilient experience for our users.
