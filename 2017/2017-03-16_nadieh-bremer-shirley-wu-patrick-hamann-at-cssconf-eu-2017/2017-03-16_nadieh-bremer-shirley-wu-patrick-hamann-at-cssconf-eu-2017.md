Time for our final speaker announcement: Patrick Hamann, Nadieh Bremer and Shirley Wu will join us for CSSconf EU!
For the second time after 2014, Patrick will bring us up to speed with the latest developments around browser performance. And for the first time, weâ€™ll have a double talk! Nadieh and Shirley will share their learnings from creating data visualizations with web technologies, and how collaboration drives their creative process.

### data sketch|es: A Visualization a Month

What do a former astronomer and a software engineer have in common? A love for data visualization! Not a joke, but a real thing: Nadieh, a data-viz designer with a background in astronomy, and Shirley, a developer who loves painting and Pixar animation, will team up on our stage. They will show us how to leverage web technologies like SVG and CSS to achieve stunning visualizations, and how their collaborative project Data sketches helped them to explore the possibilities.

## Patrick Hamann
### CSS and the First Meaningful Paint

![Patrick Hamann](patrick-hamann-blog.png)

Remember CSSconf EU 2014? Patrick introduced his work on the concept of [CSS and the Critical Path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Fk85to6hA), which has since become a key ingredient in every web developers toolkit. Much has happened in the world of browsers and performance, and this year, Patrick comes back to give us an update. His talk will take us on a journey exploring the current, past, and future best-practices for loading CSS in the browser and how we can achieve a first meaningful paint within 1000ms, creating a faster, more resilient experience for our users.
