Unsurprisingly, Berlin is famous for its Asian cuisine scene and [Cocolo Ramen](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Cocolo-Ramen-X-Berg/480234328730559) is right at the center of it. With locations in both Kreuzberg and Mitte, Cocolo Ramen serves craftily made mouth-watering noodle dishes, on par with their authentic Japanese counterparts. Cocolo Ramen in Kreuzberg is suitably located next to the popular Maybachufer canal, in a beautiful, green setting. The menu is simple and sweet and includes veggie options. Expect to pay between €7.5 - €10 per bowl.
