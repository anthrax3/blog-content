**Gipsstr. 3, 10119 Berlin** ([map])</span>

The Asian cuisine scene in Berlin is huge and [Cocolo Ramen](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Cocolo-Ramen-X-Berg/480234328730559) is right at the center of it. With locations in both Kreuzberg and Mitte, Cocolo Ramen serves craftily made mouth-watering noodle dishes, on par with their authentic Japanese counterparts. Cocolo Ramen in Kreuzberg is suitably located next to the popular Maybachufer canal, in a beautiful, green setting. The menu is simple and sweet and includes veggie options. Expect to pay between €7.5 - €10 per bowl. 

##Umami

##Spätzleexpress
<span style="font-size:.85em;">*Wiener Straße 11, 10999 Berlin ([map]) | Mon - Sun 12.00 - 22.00 | €<span style="color:grey">€€€</span>**</span>

[Spätzleexpress](http://www.spaetzleexpress.de/) is a non-fancy, self-service type of establishment. It made our list because it offers *typical* German food and we swear by its Spätzle dishes. Spätzle is a German type of pasta... [Wikipedia can explain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sp%C3%A4tzle). It's delicious, filling, and cheap!

Spätzleexpress has an extensive menu with daily specials. Expect to pay between €5 - 7 per meal.
