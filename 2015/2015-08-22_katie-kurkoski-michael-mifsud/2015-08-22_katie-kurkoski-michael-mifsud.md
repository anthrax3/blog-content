Katie is a front end developer for Getty Images in Seattle, USA and a veteran of the days of table-based layouts. She also fiddles with Nodebots, volunteers for GDI Seattle, and curates CascadiaJS. When not in front of a computer, she can often be found making glass art, or playing with dice and super heroes.
