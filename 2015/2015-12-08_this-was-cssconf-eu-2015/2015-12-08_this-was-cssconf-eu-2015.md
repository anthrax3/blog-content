More than two months later, remembering CSSconf EU 2015 still gets us as exhilarated as if it were only yesterday. So we, the organizers and team, wanted to say one very big THANK YOU:

Thank you to our attendees, all 400+ of them, who came from all corners of the world and made CSSconf EU 2015 the marvellous event it was. Thank you for being a part of it, it wouldn’t have been possible without you!

Thank you to our speakers - Claudina Sarahe, Una Kravetz, Michael Mifsud, Glen Maddern, Tammie Lister, Katie Kurkoski, Tim Holman, Lea Verou, Horia Dragomir, Zoe M. Gillenwater – the 10 fantastically talented individuals who shared their knowledge, ideas and insights and brought magic to our stage. Thank you, we could not have hoped for a better line-up!

Thank you to our sponsors. To SinnerSchrader, the enabler of CSSconf and JSConf EU. To MailChimp, Hoefler & Co, Travis CI, Etecture, GitHub, HitFox, keyCDN, Hoodie, Automattic, Namely who contributed to making this event possible – we are grateful and humbled by your support! 

As you probably remember, this was the first year where we had a dedicated Diversity Support programme[[http://2015.cssconf.eu/scholarships/]] so as to allow more people from underrepresented backgrounds to join CSSconf EU. We are eternally grateful to everyone who supported us in this pursuit! Thank you to the individuals who purchased diversity support tickets, to those who donated a ticket, and to the sponsors who helped fund our diversity effort. Thanks to your contributions, we were able to invite more 15 scholars.

As always, we are thrilled to be able to provide all talks from the conference to the community for free; they are available here [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL37ZVnwpeshHoV6GgvG9WWAP6rjnEdAs9].

For the community, from the community: Thanks for being part of it and see you at the next one!
