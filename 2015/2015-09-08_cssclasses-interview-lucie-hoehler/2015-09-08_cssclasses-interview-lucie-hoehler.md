Designed for beginners and experts alike, [CSSclasses](http://cssclasses.cssconf.eu/) is a series of one-day events for anyone interested in getting acquainted and creative with CSS. These part workshops, part hackathons are free to attend, organized by CSSconf EU and [OpenTechSchool](http://www.opentechschool.org/), and designed and delivered by a group of volunteer developers.

Launched in 2014, CSSclasses is an ambitious initiative aiming to make the introduction to coding not only more attractive, but also more accessible. Why CSS? Because it’s one of the most creative yet easy coding languages to get into. 

We spoke to [Lucie Höhler](https://twitter.com/autofocus) of the CSSconf EU team - Lucie is a CSSclasses alumnus-turned-coach. She is a front end developer in the making and recently started her first front end gig at [HitFox TechDev](https://twitter.com/HitFoxTechDev) here in Berlin.

<span class="strong-border">How did you end up at your very first CSSclasses event? What motivated you to attend?</span>
I might have seen a tweet advertising it or maybe an invitation on meetup. I was teaching myself to code at that time and had already found out that [OpenTechSchool](http://www.opentechschool.org/) interesting (and free!) classes every now and then. I already knew some CSS, but it was very basic. To have a class with a curriculum and - most importantly - coaches whom you can ask questions, was a perfect opportunity to fill in the gaps in my knowledge and get a better, more well-structured understanding of CSS. I think it’s always a good idea to take a class or a workshop when you’re learing something new. This way you’re “forced” to really dedicate a whole day just to that, and you have the opportunity to work together with others (and get to know them) and maybe even ask some questions. Plus, it’s much more fun than doing it alone! 

<span class="strong-border">What, do you think, is the significance of these events?</span>
Workshops like CSSclasses offer a really low-threshold access to a lot of things: knowledge of course, but also much more - meeting like-minded people with similar goals (like learning to code) as well as people who have already achieved that and might give advice on how to get there. People who just want to share their knowledge, sometimes because at another time, someone did the same for them (that is my main motivation). If you’re trying to get into web development and learn how to code or improve your knowledge - no matter if it’s professionally or for other reasons - beside the factual stuff you also need encouragement, a community and the feeling that “you can do it”. Also: creativity and fun! For me, CSS classes offered all of that and I really hope it does so for others. 

<span class="strong-border">What does a day at CSSclasses look like?</span>

The next CSSclasses will be held on **[September 20 at Co.Up Berlin](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-berlin/events/225073641/)**. Anyone is welcome to sign up and join us for a day of educational, creative, fun coding. We'd also love to hear from potential coaches who'd be happy to share their knowledge within the community!

Thanks for reading! <3
