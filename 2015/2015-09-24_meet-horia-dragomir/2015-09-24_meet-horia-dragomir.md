Horia is currently a UI Engineer at Facebook, and in the past has worked on everything from design to project management, in all sorts of companies, from Social Gaming to Investment Banks. 

His talk is titled _**I don't want to be on Facebook the whole day!**_ and it tells the story of building messenger.com. Horia will give us a glimpse into how CSS is used at Facebook, and how it worked both for and against the developers tasked with working on the first secondary domain: messenger.com. 

Warning: contains cool CSS and a bit of React.
