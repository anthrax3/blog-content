Michael is a front end engineer at [99designs](http://99designs.com) where he focuses on performance and tooling. He is a core contributor to LibSass and the Node Sass project lead. He also started the MelbCSS Meetup and organizes [CSSConf AU](http://2015.cssconf.com.au/). 

Michael’s talk, _It's All Just Functions And Variables_, will tell the story of how weeks of being taunted by nonsensical compiler errors and a supportive community turned him, a "lowly" frontend developer, into a core contributor to LibSass - a large C/C++ project. He will unravel the stigma that "front end developers aren't real programmers" which propagates through the industry and into the hearts and minds of fellow developers. Michael will convince you that regardless of whether you write CSS, JavaScript or COBOL, you are as much a programmer as anyone on your team or the intenet, and that it's not our languages that define us but our willingness to learn to master our domain. 

We approached Michael to ask him about CSS, programming, pizza, and more:

<span class="strong-border">Hi Michael! Thanks for taking the time to answer some questions for us. Besides being busy speaking at conferences, what are you working on at the moment?</span>
A delicious pizza.  
The rest of my time is spent on my open source work with LibSass and Node-Sass, and with my friends organising our local CSS meetup and [CSSConf AU](http://2015.cssconf.com.au/). 

<span class="strong-border">What is an upcoming CSS feature that you can’t wait to see widely supported by browsers?</span>
I’m a performance nut so I’d love to support for webp, woff2, unicode-range and http/2 land everywhere!

<span class="strong-border">Do you have a favorite CSS property, and if yes, what is it?</span>
*zoom: 1
You know why…

<span class="strong-border">What CSS quirk has cost you the most nerves so far?</span>
Easily attr().

	“The [attr() function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/attr) can be used with any CSS property, but support for properties other than content is experimental.” -

<span class="strong-border">If you didn't work on the web, what would your profession be?</span>
World-travelling professional poker player and semi-professional pizza eater.

<span class="strong-border">Have you been to Berlin before, and what are you looking forward to the most?</span>
No I haven’t. It’s been on the top of my list for a long time so I’m super excited. I’m psyched for the beer and sausages. I also have some internet friends in town I’ll finally get to meet up with in person.

<span class="strong-border">What do you like most about giving talks at conferences?</span>
I love meeting new people. It’s also great to see the silly things I work inspire people, some of whom have even inspired me.

<span class="strong-border">We don’t want to spoil it, but… what is the one thing that you wish everyone in the audience takes away from your talk?</span>
Even if all you do all day is write Sass/JavaScript and google stackoverflow. You’re still as much of a programmer as anyone else on your team. Don’t let anyone tell you differently.

<span class="strong-border">Are there things you want to improve about yourself (maybe anything you’re working on at the moment or are planning to do so in the future)? If yes, which ones?</span>
Since being responsible for LibSass and Node Sass I’ve been really trying to upskill my c/c++ know how. It’s a struggle because there is very little good introductory material.

<span class="strong-border">If you could make one wish: What would you like to change in our industry?</span>
Just for more acceptance. There is too much ego and fear in our industry. I feel like it holds us back as whole.
