Zoe is a senior designer for [Booking.com](http://booking.com]. She is the author of two books on CSS and visual web design, and she recently wrote the chapter on flexbox for Smashing Magazineâ€™s new Real-Life Responsive Web Design book.


<span class="strong-border">Hi Michael! Thanks for taking the time to answer some questions for us. Besides being busy speaking at conferences, what are you working on at the moment?</span>
A delicious pizza.  
The rest of my time is spent on my open source work with LibSass and Node-Sass, and with my friends organising our local CSS meetup and [CSSConf AU](http://2015.cssconf.com.au/).
