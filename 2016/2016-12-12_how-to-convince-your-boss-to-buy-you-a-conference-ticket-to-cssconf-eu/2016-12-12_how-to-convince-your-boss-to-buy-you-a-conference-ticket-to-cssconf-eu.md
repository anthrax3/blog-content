You write CSS all day. You are your team’s front end expert (or want to become one). You are responsible for maintaining your company’s brand consistency. Perfecting the UI of your app. Explorer of styles, wrangler of SVG, composer of components.

You HAVE to attend CSSconf EU, and you know it – but how to get your boss to buy you that ticket?

## Talk business. There’s an ROI in attending a conference.

When you approach your manager to ask for a CSSconf EU ticket, be aware that you are not the only one who profits from spending a nice day watching talks and sipping free coffee. Companies benefit in many ways too – after all their employees grow their knowledge, motivation and network!

Some companies are very aware of this, and you might already have a conference budget in your contract. Maybe your manager even encourages you to attend events and helps you to grow. But not all of us get that support handed on a silver spoon – so know your arguments, and you can convince even a skeptical boss.

### Training
* Explain why you want to attend CSSconf EU, and what you plan to learn there. Make sure you know the topics of the conference, and explain to your boss how you will benefit from hearing about them. Mention any specific pain points your team might have: slow processes, knowledge gaps, lack of code quality… and point out how CSSconf EU would boost you and your team in tackling these problems.

* Share your learnings with the team: Offer to give a lunch talk about the conference and your most important take-aways. At the very minimum, send a quick email to your team with a summary and some links to interesting tools or techniques you learned about.
Write a blogpost on the company blog: This is not only a good way to report back to your team, it also publicly shows your company’s caring about participating in community events.

### Motivation and Inspiration

* CSSconf EU brings together international experts on frontend development, both on stage and in the audience. You get to learn from them, not only during talks, but also during breaks and the evening events. Connecting, chatting and learning from top notch developers can be incredibly inspiring! You’ll find yourself surrounded by diverse people who work on the exact same problems you do. You’ll return motivated and eager to apply your new learnings in your team, and which boss wouldn’t love to see some fresh energy?

### Recruiting

* Networking is your special skill? Offer to recruit at the event. Your company is desperately looking for new talent? Great – there’s no better place to meet skilled designers and frontend developers than CSSconf EU. Offer to actively connect with people and let them know how great working at your company is.

### Promote your product

* Your company sells a service or a product that is relevant to web developers and designers? Show some presence at CSSconf EU! You can raise awareness for your brand, get direct feedback from your users, gain some new ones, and show that your company cares about its community.

## Be prepared for a NO – and don’t give up

You might hear one of the following:

*“We have no budget”*
Don’t give up, but be prepared with the numbers. Calculate what the ticket would cost, but also accommodation and travel if you need it.
Keep in mind that your company can deduct tax from everything.

Is this investment in your training worth it or not? Ask your boss why they think it isn’t.

*“We have no time”*
Your boss claims you can’t miss a day in the office. Getting stuff done is more important than educating yourself.

Again, be prepared with some hard facts: Remind them how many hours you wasted on solving a problem recently. Is your CSS code base a mess and hardly maintainable? Are your designers complaining about super slow implementation of UI features? What about the animation that would really improve your landing page, but no one knows how to do it?
The work hours you’ll miss by attending CSSconf EU will easily be gained back later! And it’s on a Friday anyway ;)

## But I already went to 10 conferences this year…

Great! We hope you got to attend some insightful events. Did you make sure to thank your company for the opportunity, and report back on your learnings? If you did: Good job! You are helping to build a company culture that values their employees’ learning and growing.
Why not take it one step further. Look around: Are there people in your team who’d really benefit from attending CSSconf EU? Maybe they are not in a position to ask, or are not experienced in negotiating like you are. Go advocate for them! Point out to your boss that your junior designer or front-end trainee could really benefit from that experience. Or be a mentor to your coworkers, and share some tricks on how to successfully approach your manager about conference tickets.

## Did you know: Sponsors get tickets too

If your personal conference budget is exhausted, maybe your company has a budget for sponsorships. Did you know all CSSconf EU sponsorships include free tickets for the company? If your direct manager can’t find a budget for your ticket, maybe the marketing department can.

## But I’m my own boss?

Congratulations, then you only have to convince yourself! For freelancers, all of the above reasons apply too. We’d even argue that a conference like CSSconf EU is *the* place to meet and connect with new clients, especially international ones.


If you are dealing with financial hardships that make a ticket purchase impossible for you: Consider applying to our [Scholarship program](http://2017.cssconf.eu/scholarships/).

We hope those tips are useful – and are excited to see you at CSSconf EU in May!
