## Diversity Support Tickets

We are again offering [Diversity Support Tickets](http://2017.cssconf.eu/diversity-support-tickets/). The same as last year, you are purchasing a ticket for yourself and at the same time helping another person of the conference’s choosing be able to attend the event.

There’s a range of “Support Options”: Starting with paying for 25% of a ticket to paying for a full ticket. We thank you in advance for your generosity and awesomeness and look forward to a more diverse CSSconf EU than ever before.

## What your ticket buys you

Your ticket buys you entrance to the conference CSSconf EU on May 5, including full catering (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, drinks).
Your ticket also guarantees you entrance to all social events around the conference, including the parties of JSConf EU on Saturday & Sunday, and relax.js on Monday.
